## Assembly
1. Print required parts. These parts were printed in standard PLA on a filament-style 3D printer.
2. Cut straws to 2.25" length.
3. Slide threaded side of LaminarNozzleFitting-Short into the LaminarNozzleBody-Wide
4. Screw the LaminarNozzleFitting-Female-Short onto the LaminarNozzleFitting-Short to hold in in place
5. Cut two 6" circles of screen door material and superglue them onto the MeshHolderSpacer-Wide hoops.
7. Cut two semicircles out of Scotch-Brite to make a 6" diameter circle and glue it into one of the hoops.
8. Slide the hoop with the scotch-brite (scouring pad side down) into the LaminarNozzleBody-Wide until it rests against the lip.
9. Load the MeshHolderSpacer-Wide with cut plastic straws.
10. Slide the other hoop into the top and glue in place with superglue.
11. Cut the 1" ID hose to length and attach to the hose fitting on the MeshHolderSpacer-Wide and the Dental PAPR - TR300 Y Adapter.
12. Connect the CPAP tubing to the connector on the Y Adapter. For the child version, it can be helpful to add a band of velcro to the "fingers" on the connector to hook up with the velcro pad on the eleastic band on the Pixi.
13. 3M BT 30 Length Adjusting Breathing Tube to the fitting at the base of the Y-Adapter
